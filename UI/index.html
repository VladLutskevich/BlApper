                <p>Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the
                    Premier League, the top tier of
                    English football. The club has won six European Cups, more than any other English club, three UEFA
                    Cups, four UEFA Super Cups
                    (both also English records), one FIFA Club World Cup, eighteen League titles, seven FA Cups, a
                    record eight League Cups, fifteen
                    FA Community Shields and one Football League Super Cup. Founded in 1892, the club joined the
                    Football League the following year
                    and has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in
                    English and European football in
                    the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a
                    combined eleven League titles
                    and four European Cups. Under the management of Rafael Benítez and captained by homegrown player
                    Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became
                    European champions for the fifth time in 2005, before a sixth title was added under Jürgen Klopp in
                    2019. Liverpool was the seventh
                    highest-earning football club in the world in 2019, with an annual revenue of €513.7 million,[3] and
                    the world's eighth most valuable
                    football club in 2019, valued at $2.183 billion.[4] The club is one of the most widely supported
                    teams in the world.[5] Liverpool has
                    long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. The club's supporters have been involved
                    in two major tragedies: the Heysel
                    Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European
                    Cup Final in Brussels, with 39 people – mostly
                    Italians and Juventus fans – dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from
                    European competition, and the Hillsborough disaster
                    in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing. The team changed
                    from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has
                    been used ever since. Red has been the main shirt colour ever since 1896.[6] The club's anthem is
                    "You'll Never Walk Alone".</p>

                <p>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays
                    in the Premier League, the top flight of English football.
                    The club has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 15 FA Community Shields, 1
                    League Centenary Trophy, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and 1 Inter-Cities
                    Fairs Cup. Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in
                    1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once,
                    in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division,[3] and have won the second-most
                    top-flight matches in English football history.[4] In the 1930s, Arsenal
                    won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the
                    war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double.
                    Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles.
                    They completed the 20th century with the highest average league
                    position.[5] Herbert Chapman won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped
                    introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers,[6]
                    and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's kit. Arsène Wenger was the
                    longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record 7 FA Cups,
                    and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at
                    49 games between 2003 and 2004,[7] receiving the nickname The Invincibles.
                    In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the
                    city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur,
                    and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. In terms of
                    revenue, Arsenal is the ninth highest-earning football club in the world,
                    earned €487.6m in 2016–17 season.[8] Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's
                    fanbase is the fifth largest in the world.[8] In 2018,
                    Forbes estimated the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth $2.24
                    billion.[9]</p>
